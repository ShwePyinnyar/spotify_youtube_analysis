# Spotify & YouTube Data Analysis

In this project, I analyzed the `spotify_youtube` dataset to answer various questions about artists, tracks, albums, and YouTube engagement.  

> **Note:** The original CSV file had a `Description` column containing lyrics and long text. This column was removed to reduce file size and make the dataset GitHub-friendly.
